.TH PULSE-VISUALIZER 1 "@CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION@" "Pulse Visualizer"

.SH NAME
pulse-visualizer \- Real-time audio visualizer with analog CRT phosphor emulation

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Pulse
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Pulse is a real-time audio visualizer that transforms system audio from PulseAudio or PipeWire
into eye-catching visual effects. It features hardware-accelerated graphics with multiple
visualization styles including Lissajous curves, oscilloscope displays, FFT spectrum analysis,
and spectrograms. The application includes authentic analog CRT phosphor emulation powered by
GPU compute shaders for realistic glow and persistence effects.

.SH OPTIONS

.SH CONFIGURATION
The application reads its configuration from \fI~/.config/pulse-visualizer/config.json\fR.
If this file doesn't exist, it will be created from a template on first run.
The configuration supports live updates and allows selection of audio backend
(PulseAudio or PipeWire), visualization settings, phosphor effect parameters,
and theme selection.

.SH THEMES
Themes are stored in \fI~/.config/pulse-visualizer/themes/\fR and can be selected
by editing the "default_theme" field in the configuration file. Multiple pre-made
themes are included with the application.

.SH VISUALIZERS
.TP
.B Lissajous
Displays stereo audio as X-Y plots with Catmull-Rom spline interpolation
.TP
.B Oscilloscope
Shows waveform data with configurable gradient modes and phosphor effects
.TP
.B FFT Spectrum
Frequency analysis with mid/side and left/right channel modes
.TP
.B Spectrogram
Time-frequency visualization showing spectral content over time

.SH REQUIREMENTS
Requires OpenGL 4.3 or newer for phosphor effects. Works on Linux and BSD systems
with PulseAudio or PipeWire (0.3+) for audio capture.

.SH AUTHOR
Written for the Pulse Visualizer project.

.SH BUGS
Report bugs at the project repository. Note that phosphor effects can be
resource-intensive and may vary in brightness with window size.
